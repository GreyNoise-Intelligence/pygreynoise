This is an abstract python library built on top of the `GreyNoise`_ service. It is preferred that users use this library when implementing integrations or plan to use GreyNoise within their code. The library includes a small client to interact with the API.

``pip install greynoise`` or ``python setup.py install``

**Save your configuration**:

``greynoise setup --api-key <your-API-key>``

Versioning
==========
This python package follows semantic versioning. According to this:

* We will NEVER push a breaking change without a major version release.
* We will only add new features and/or bug fixes with minor version releases.
* We will only do bug fixes for patch version release.

As such, we recommend you pin the dependency on this SDK to only allow minor version changes at most:

::

    # allow patch version increments
    greynoise~=1.4.0

    # allow minor version increments
    greynoise~=1.4
